# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look at if there are predictive measures to determine if a theater kickstarter campaign will be successful or not. In this case, we are looking at financial goals/outcomes of a variety of kickstarters that are in the past (kickstarters currently in progress ("live") were not used in this study). 

## Analysis and Challenges
We looked at a dataset that had a collection of both financial and verbal data. This dataset had a variety of both qualitative and quantitative data. We used this data to categorize our focal point (outcomes, in this situation) and summarize the outcomes based on many discrete and categorical criteria. For the purpose of this analysis, we compared the Launch Dates of theater kickstarter campaigns (categorical data organized by month) with the outcome of the campaign (possible outcomes included "Successful", "live", "Canceled", and "failed". For the purpose of our study, we did not focus on the "live" outcomes, as they were still in progress). We made these comparisons through using a Pivot Table in Excel, as well as line graphs in Excel (linked [here]). We also compared the same outcomes (success, fail, canceled) to the goal fundraising data (discrete values ranging from $1 to $100,000,000). We compared these using a line graph (linked [here]), as well as by creating table to view successes/failures as percentages rather than total values. 

## Results
This study found that the theater kickstarters with the highest rates of success had fundraising goals of less than $1000 (71% success rate). The kickstarters with fundraising goals greater than $50,000 had the lowest rate of success (42% success rate). Most kickstarters had a fundraising goal between $1000 and $4999 (1412 fundraisers) with a 66% success rate (932 successful campaigns). Kickstarters tended to be canceled more often in goal ranges that are larger, with the most cancellations coming in the "Greater than $50,000" category (23). 

## Conclusions
##### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
The highest number of successful kickstarter campaigns are launched in the summer months (May, June, July). In addition, the highest number of failed kickstarter campaigns are launched in May, July, and October. The summer months (May through July) also had the highest number of funding campaigns launched compared to the whole year, so we cannot determine whether or not the summer launches lead to more successful campaigns. Across all months, an average of 61.2% of campaigns were successful, with the highest success rates coming in May (67%) and June (65%). The lowest success rate comes in December (49%). 

##### Outcomes Based on Goals
From these results, we can conclude that the lower fundraising goals were more likely to be reached than higher fundraising goals. We can suggest that future kickstarters should price their campaign goals to be less than $1000 for the highest success rate. If they need more funding, the highest success rates were found were in ranges of less than $1000 (71% success), $1000 to $4999 (66%) and $5000 to $9999 (53%). Kickstarters with campaign goals greater than $10,000 are typically less than 50% successful, so a kickstarter should be aware that they may not reach their fundraising goal if they ask above that threshold.

### Limitations
One of the limitations to this dataset is that there is no reasoning on why some of these kickstarters were "canceled". It could be possible that some of the canceled kickstarters were on the path to failure, so the company pulled out of the funding campaign. Or, the kickstarter could have been successful, but was canceled for other reasons (environmental, change of personnel, etc), as four of the kickstarters were ruled "canceled", but had reached their fundraising goal. Both of these situations (among countless other possibilities) leads us to be unsure of the true potential of success for kickstarters based on funding goals. Another limitation to this study is that we only looked at theater kickstarters for the Outcomes by Launch Date comparison, but not the Outcomes by Goals comparison. The Outcomes by Goals figure is not specific to theater kickstarters, therefore we should not draw harsh conclusions in regards to theater specific kickstarters. 

### Other Graphs and Tables
Other tables that we could use could specify theater kickstarters in the Outcomes based on Goals sheet to discern how successful theater kickstarters were compared to goal funding ranges. I think it would also be interesting to look at the outcomes compared to backer counts, to see if successful campaigns had many smaller donors or a few very large donors.
